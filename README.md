### Greetings, tree!

Some things I'm learning:

* Rust
* Go
* Liquid Haskell
* Character art
* Jazz piano
* Irish trad violin
* Chinese
* Japanese
* Perfect pitch (still not sure if it's possible)
* How to actually finish things instead of opening a new tab for everything... will be my epitaph.

### How to reach me

* Open an issue on my [personal repo](https://github.com/DestyNova/DestyNova)
* Send me an email, if you already happen to know the address
* Leave an angry comment on [my blog](https://overto.eu) (powered by really neato "serverless" [Utterances](https://utteranc.es) widget which uses Github issues as a commenting system).
